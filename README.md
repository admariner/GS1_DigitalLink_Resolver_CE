## ðŸ“¢ Version 3.0 is Imminent!

We're thrilled to announce that the new **GS1 Resolver v3.0** is on the brink of release, bringing significant enhancements:

1. **Multiple Links**: Serve multiple links from a single context, a notable improvement over the previous single-link limitation. This is particularly useful if your product has multiple certificates or related documents.

2. **Simplified Data Input**: The data input methods have been revamped for user-friendliness. The complex structures of versions 1 and 2 are now obsolete, paving the way for straightforward data entry.

3. **Separate GTIN Qualifiers**: GTIN qualifiers are now independent, free from a fixed 'qualifier path', offering enhanced flexibility.

4. **Unified Database**: Streamline your infrastructure as maintaining both SQL *and* Document databases is no longer necessaryâ€”only the Document database is required.

The rollout of the latest version is scheduled for **April 2024**. It will be introduced here in this 'V3' branch in this **GitHub** project and labeled as a **release-candidate**. This allows for thorough testing, ensuring all bugs are addressed and that the Resolver is fully compliant with GS1 Digital Link standards.
